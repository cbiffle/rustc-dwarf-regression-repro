# Missing DWARF repro case

Starting with the nightly-2021-09-23 revision, rustc quit producing DWARF info
for static variables defined in lib crates in release builds with LTO enabled.
Static variables in bin crates are still fine.

This demonstrates the issue.

To build:

```
$ cargo build --release
```

To confirm: apply dwarfdump to output. You should find a variable called
`THE_STATIC`. But you won't.
